    <h1>Framework Overview</h1>
    <div class="hr"></div>

    <p>
      <em>Sound as Event</em> approaches sound not as a recorded object, but as an event shaped by time, embodiment, decision, and structural context.
      Sound is understood as something that occurs rather than something that exists independently.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Position</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sound is temporally situated rather than materially fixed.</li>
      <li>Sound gains structure through conditions of occurrence rather than predefined forms.</li>
      <li>The framework is not prescriptive; it does not dictate an aesthetic, medium, or technique.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Event Dimensions (Applied Studies)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./breath.html">Breath as Event</a> — embodied initiation (whether sound may occur)</li>
      <li><a href="./pulse.html">Pulse as Event</a> — temporal decision (when sound may occur)</li>
      <li><a href="./voice.html">Voice as Event</a> — execution and presence (who/what performs the sound)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Read This Project</h2>
    <p>
      The studies are indexed for continuity rather than hierarchy. Each paper stands independently while remaining structurally related to the framework.
      Together they articulate an integrated yet open ground for examining sound-based practice as event-based occurrence.
