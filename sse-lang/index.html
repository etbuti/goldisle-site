SSE-Lang v0.2<br>
<br>
A Structured Rule Language for Feasibility Judgement<br>
SSE-Lang (Structured Safety & Evaluation Language) is a lightweight rule-based language <br>
for expressing feasibility judgement in scientific and engineering contexts <br>
where fully quantitative modeling is unavailable or inappropriate.<br>
<br>
Instead of predicting outcomes, SSE-Lang formalizes expert-style reasoning: <br>
conditional exclusions, necessary constraints, and advisory considerations. <br>
It distinguishes hard rules, which define strict infeasibility, from soft (advisory) rules, <br>
which signal caution without vetoing feasibility.<br>
<br>
In v0.2, SSE-Lang introduces derived semantics, <br>
allowing higher-level indicators to be inferred <br>
from multiple qualitative inputs rather than manually specified. <br>
<br>
Each evaluation produces a transparent judgement trace, <br>
including triggered rules, derived indicators, and a stable trace identifier.
<br>
<br>
SSE-Lang is deterministic, interpretable, and auditable. <br>
It does not replace expert judgement, but provides a formal scaffold <br>
that makes decision logic explicit and discussable.
