SSE-Lang v0.2

A Structured Rule Language for Feasibility Judgement

SSE-Lang (Structured Safety & Evaluation Language) is a lightweight rule-based language for expressing feasibility judgement in scientific and engineering contexts where fully quantitative modeling is unavailable or inappropriate.

Instead of predicting outcomes, SSE-Lang formalizes expert-style reasoning: conditional exclusions, necessary constraints, and advisory considerations. It distinguishes hard rules, which define strict infeasibility, from soft (advisory) rules, which signal caution without vetoing feasibility.

In v0.2, SSE-Lang introduces derived semantics, allowing higher-level indicators to be inferred from multiple qualitative inputs rather than manually specified. Each evaluation produces a transparent judgement trace, including triggered rules, derived indicators, and a stable trace identifier.

SSE-Lang is deterministic, interpretable, and auditable. It does not replace expert judgement, but provides a formal scaffold that makes decision logic explicit and discussable.
