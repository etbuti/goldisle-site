SSE-Lang Input Syntax v0.1.1 (Public Checker)

Status: Public demonstrator syntax for the SSE-Lang judgement endpoint.
Scope: Defines the input language accepted by the public checker at /sse-lang/check/.
Non-goal: This syntax does not disclose the full rule system; it only standardizes how inputs are expressed for feasibility screening.

1. Overview

The SSE-Lang judgement endpoint accepts a sequence of statements terminated by semicolons.
Statements set semantic fields (key-value assignments) and may include an explicit evaluation command.

Minimal pattern:
Key: Value;
...
CHECK;

The checker normalizes the parsed assignments into a field → value mapping and evaluates them against the SSE-Lang v0.1 infeasibility ruleset.

2. Lexical Conventions

2.1 Whitespace

Spaces, tabs, and newlines may appear between tokens and do not affect meaning.

2.2 Comments

Single-line comments start with // and continue to end-of-line.

IonPathDimensionality: #3D; // comment

2.3 Identifiers

Identifiers (ident) are used for keys and enum segments:
	•	Must start with [A-Za-z_]
	•	May contain [A-Za-z0-9_\-]

Examples:
	•	IonPathDimensionality
	•	DataReliability
	•	ModerateOrWorseCount

3. Grammar (EBNF)
program      := statement* EOF ;

statement    := assign ";" 
             | query ";" ;

assign       := ident ( ":" | "=" ) value ;

query        := "CHECK" | "EVAL" ;

value        := number
             | string
             | symbol
             | enumPath ;

enumPath     := ident ( "." ident )* ;

symbol       := "#" ident ;

string       := '"' { CHAR - '"' } '"' ;

ident        := /[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_\-]*/ ;
number       := /-?\d+(\.\d+)?/ ;

4. Semantics

4.1 Assignments

Assignments set a field value:

IonPathDimensionality: #3D;
DataReliability = reliability.partial;
ModerateOrWorseCount: 2;

Duplicate keys overwrite earlier values (last assignment wins).

4.2 Evaluation Query

The query statement is optional in the current public demonstrator:

CHECK;

	•	If present, it indicates an explicit evaluation point.
	•	If absent, the checker still evaluates using all parsed assignments.

Both CHECK; and EVAL; are accepted and equivalent in v0.1.1.

In v0.1.1, CHECK/EVAL marks an evaluation point but does not introduce segmented or multi-stage execution.
5. Normalization Rules (Critical for Reproducibility)

The public checker applies the following normalizations before rule evaluation:

5.1 Key Canonicalization

Input keys are mapped to canonical rule fields using the ruleset alias table (rules.json → aliases).
If a key matches an alias (case-insensitive), it is rewritten to the canonical field name.

Example mapping (illustrative):
	•	IonPathDimensionality → Ion Path Dimensionality
	•	DataReliability → Data Reliability

If no alias matches, the key is used as-is.

5.2 Value Normalization

Numbers
	•	Parsed as integer or float.

Strings
	•	"..."
	•	Preserved then lowercased for comparison.

Symbols
	•	#3D parses as the symbol 3D
	•	Normalized to lower-case for evaluation: 3d

Enum Paths
	•	reliability.partial parses as segments ["reliability","partial"]
	•	Normalized by taking the last segment and lowercasing: partial

This is designed to allow domain-qualified enums without burdening v0.1 rule comparators.

6. Examples

6.1 Minimal Feasibility Check

IonPathDimensionality: #3D;
PathContinuity: #flexible;
DataReliability: reliability.partial;
ModerateOrWorseCount: 2;
CHECK;

6.2 Using Strings and Numbers

SynthesisAccessibility: "difficult";
ElectrochemicalWindow: 4.8;
EVAL;

6.3 With Comments

IonPathDimensionality: #1D; // low dimensionality
DataReliability: reliability.full;
CHECK;

7. Error Handling

The parser reports:
	•	A short error message
	•	A line/column location
	•	A context snippet with a caret pointer

Typical errors:
	•	Missing semicolon ;
	•	Unterminated string "...
	•	Unexpected character
	•	Invalid value position

String literals may not contain newlines in v0.1.1.

8. Backward Compatibility (Legacy Input)

For continuity, the public checker may also accept legacy “Key: Value” line format when the input does not resemble SSE-Lang syntax.

Legacy example:

Ion Path Dimensionality: 3D
Data Reliability: partial
Count of attributes rated moderate or worse: 2

Note: Legacy support is provided for convenience and does not define the SSE-Lang syntax.

9. Versioning Notes
	•	v0.1.1 defines input syntax only for the public judgement endpoint.
	•	SSE-Lang v0.1 rules remain the authoritative infeasibility criteria.
	•	Future versions may extend:
	•	typed units
	•	structured semantic units
	•	derived-field computation (e.g., automatically computing counts from ratings)
	•	formal proof/trace exports
